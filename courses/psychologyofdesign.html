<h2>Psychology of Design</h2>

<h4>What is it, why do I need it, and how do I use it?</h4>

<blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design">
<p>&quot;A design is a plan or specification for the construction of an object or system or for the implementation of an activity or process, or the result of that plan or specification in the form of a prototype, product or process.&quot; - Wikipedia</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Design is something we&#39;re all familiar with. It&#39;s in our apps, our phones, the websites we visit, the cars we drive and even the houses we live in. That&#39;s not even talking about artwork, where the imagery can make us feel happy, sad, on edge, angry, scared, calm and everything in between. Why does this work, and how would you even implement it? Lucky you, that&#39;s the question I&#39;m going to attempt to answer in this article.</p>

<p>Design, specifically visual design, is closely related to art. It could almost be considered a form of art in itself. Like art, there are distinct principles: repetition, contrast, proximity, and alignment.</p>

<h3>Repetition</h3>

<p>The principle of repetition is all about repeating one or more components throughout a web page. The repetition ties all of the elements together. Whether it is color, shape, font, or image, repetition helps to unify the design. Humans are extremely good at recognizing patterns. When repetition is used correctly, it can:</p>

<ol class="article-list">
	<li>Organize information coherently</li>
	<li>Guide the audience in a clear way</li>
	<li>Help your visitors anticipate how things will work</li>
</ol>

<h3>Contrast</h3>

<p>To apply the principle of contrast, emphasize the difference between page elements to make the design interesting and direct attention. There should always be good contrast between the background color and the text color on the page, that is if you want people to read it. Here is an example of what not to do.&nbsp;<br />
<span style="background-color: red; color:blue;">Eye-straining text</span></p>

<h3>Proximity</h3>

<p>To apply the principle of proximity, related items are placed physically close together. Unrelated items should have space separating them. This ultimately boils down to your use of whitespace. Too much and it looks awkward and sloppy. Too little and it becomes practically unreadable.</p>

<h3>Alignment</h3>

<p>To apply the principle of alignment, you must organize the page so that each element placed has some alignment (vertical or horizontal) with another element on the page. For example, the navigation links are&nbsp;aligned horizontally to give a feeling of them being grouped together. The navigation links are in turn, aligned with the logo.</p>

<h3>Color</h3>

<p>Colors have a very important role in website design. Each and every color has associated feelings, symbolizations&nbsp;and meanings attached to it. Red can invoke feelings of passion, energy, and desire.&nbsp;It can also represent strength, power, war, danger, and determination when placed&nbsp;in the right context. Here is a table of common colors and some of their associated meanings and emotions.</p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1" summary="Red is passion. Blue is trust. Green is growth and harmony. Yellow is joy and intellect. Black is power and formality. Purple is nobility and luxury. Brown is dependability, reliability and resilience. Pink is playfulness and joy. White is good, pure, clean and faith. Orange is joy, sunshine and tropics.">
