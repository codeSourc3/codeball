<h2>Emotional Interface Design</h2>

<h4>What is it, why do I need it, and how do I use it?</h4>

<p>Emotional interface design, which I am going to call (EID) from now on, is the principal of designing products to evoke an emotional connection in consumers. If you&#39;re like me, you are asking yourself what the hell that means. That&#39;s a good question: I don&#39;t know. I&#39;m&nbsp;kidding, but now you may have some idea of what it is. I got you to laugh just now, didn&#39;t I? If I didn&#39;t then I&nbsp;failed in my execution ☹. In web design, emotional interface design&nbsp;means giving your website a personality, it means speaking to&nbsp;the audience person to person instead of through a filter (at least my interpretation is, you choose what works best for you). Some other ways you can implement it is by making your site more game-like such as implementing a scoreboard or checklist.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Speaking of checklists, humans love feeling a sense of accomplishment, which is why setting a goal and following it through is so rewarding, even if it&#39;s as simple as cleaning a&nbsp;bathroom or walking a certain amount of steps. So then implement that on your website. If you have a form, create a little progress bar that climbs higher and higher or place a checkmark when you fill out a field. It&#39;s the little things in life, that small amount of feedback, that makes our day-to-day activities a bit more bearable.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&quot;A bit more bearable&quot;&mdash; that could be used as a pun. You could also&nbsp;use puns on your website, or any humor as long as you know your audience. People love to laugh. That&#39;s a fact, and if it&#39;s not a fact it should be. It&#39;s why we spend time on YouTube watching Try Not To Laugh videos and laughing at&nbsp;them anyway, or watching America&#39;s Funniest Videos for entertainment. So, if it suits your site, put humor in it. Some of the best places I can think of would be on the landing page and the error page (the last one would be one of the best candidates).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Color plays a big role in emotional interface design. Depending on your goal, you may want to choose different colors for your website. Blue can be used to signify trust, safety, and relaxation. It can also signify intelligence and confidence. The color black conveys power and formality. The color red indicates passion and love, but can also be used to indicate urgency. Choose your colors wisely based on the kind of site you are. Blue shouldn&#39;t be used in websites specializing in food since it actually suppresses appetite. Black can come off as overbearing and sinister if used too much. Red can confuse the user if it&#39;s used in Call-to-Actions and as your main color. Use the colors appropriate to your use case.</p>

<p>If you implement an emotional interface design correctly, then it should increase your connection with your users. They&#39;ll be more forgiving of little hiccups and more attentive and emotionally invested. I mean, don&#39;t we all want to feel like we&#39;re valued as an individual?</p>
