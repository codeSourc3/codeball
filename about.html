<h1>About <s>Us</s>&nbsp;Me</h1>

<p>Hello fellow people, my name is Enzo and I&#39;ll be your author tonight. I&#39;m actually the creator of this website, in case you wanted to know. I&#39;m not the best at content creation so&nbsp;sorry if the site is a little... empty. It&#39;s actually not too hard to create the general framework of the website if you know <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> and <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> well enough. No, the hard part is actually figuring out what to put on the website, a.k.a., content creation. I&#39;m not the most creative person when it comes to writing, at least not unless it&#39;s about something technical. I&#39;m definitely not very good at writing in &quot;marketing-speak&quot;, you know, where they use very specific words to try to make it short and to the point while also being rich in information. Very difficult to get right, I don&#39;t know how they do it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Anyway, this website was developed for a project in my HTML &amp; CSS class as my final project. The topic I picked to make my website about was a little something called emotional interface design. It&#39;s the idea of making the <abbr title="User Interface">UI</abbr>&nbsp;feel more human. You&#39;ve probably experienced it if you&#39;ve looked at the newest phone or car. You&#39;ve definitely experienced it if you ever got frustrated at a website because you couldn&#39;t figure out how to get to the page you wanted.</p>

<p>Though I understand the concept just fine, I find it challenging to actually implement it in practice. That&#39;s probably because I don&#39;t necessarily know what I want this website to do. If I had my way, it would be somewhere in between being a blog and a coding playground. However, that would be out of the scope of the project I&#39;m supposed to make, which only uses HTML and CSS.</p>

<p>My entry into programming really began when I took a class called &quot;Intro to Programming Fundamentals&quot; during my 11th grade in high school. Up until then, I had dabbled in it, but never really developed a passion for it. That all changed when I started tinkering with a program called Alice, a block-based programming environment that enables one to create animations, narratives or simple 3D games. I loved how I could tell the computer to do something and it would actually do it, no matter if it made any sense or not. I played around with making T-Rex&#39;s tails phase into their chests and skeletons torso&#39;s flying off into the sky until we graduated to a new platform &mdash; Greenfoot. Greenfoot is built off of an actor-based model, where you have&nbsp;<em>Actors</em>&nbsp;interacting with others in a&nbsp;<em>World</em>. In this environment, we could actually program in Java code. I was fascinated.</p>

<p>One of the ideas that came to my mind was to build a top-down shooter. This was before I understood object-oriented programming. I had barely grasped the concept of a constructor, only knew how to use <code>void</code> methods and basically didn&#39;t understand what I was doing. I attempted to make a video game anyway. I don&#39;t think I need to say this, but it was a disaster. I had built the literal embodiment of spaghetti code. I still have nightmares about it. Well, that&#39;s a lie, but it&nbsp;<strong>was</strong>&nbsp;bad. This lasted until Christmas, when my grandparents gave me a book called&nbsp;<em>Beginning Java Programming: The Object-Oriented Approach</em>. I dropped my spaghetti shooter immediately and started reading that book within seconds of unwrapping it. I followed the steps to install the <abbr title="Java Virtual Machine">JVM</abbr> and started following all of their examples. I started carrying it around with me wherever I went when I could. I struggled to wrap my mind around every concept that came up: inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, abstraction. I strained and strained until I finally overcame each and every obstacle. I scoured the web looking for information that could help me avoid repeating that horrific experience, and because I like learning. It shows in my bookmark bar.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At some point during this, I also enrolled in a class that taught me HTML and CSS. It helped me understand the languages as I do today, though it took me a while to really get how it worked and how to &quot;best&quot; implement them (read: CSS). Fast forward to now, where I have created a website that is responsive, pretty, and hopefully entertaining. It was a wild ride, but look where it got me to.</p>
